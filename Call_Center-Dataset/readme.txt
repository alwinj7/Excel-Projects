The Excel file contains data from a call-center company.
The growth team of the company buys data from the market and hands it over to the calling team.
The calling team takes these numbers and starts dialing.
One calling attempt is called One call. There might be a chance the customer might not pick up the call - RnR
If the customer picks, then the caller starts selling the products - Connected Calls
There can be 2 possibilities when a customer picks up the call
